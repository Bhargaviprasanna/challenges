Hacker Earth Mother's Day Challenge
1.The libraries used are pandas, numpy, re, nltk and sklearn.
2.The first step is merging of test and train files into 'Reviews' file.
3.After merging, step by step cleaning of data in 'original_text' column, which a first column in 'Review'.
4.Using stopwords and stemming(PorterStemmer) the data is appended into corpus list.
5.This corpus is then used to create a sparse matrix using CountVectorizer.
6.Next created 'X' array and 'Y' containing 'sentiment_class'.
7.Splitting of X_train,X-test,y_train and y_test using the no of rows in train.csv.
8.Using RandomForestClassifier with trees=10, criterion='entropy' trained the model.
9.using f1_score from sklearn metrics, calculated the score for X_train actualvalues and predictedvalues.
10.The test data id and its prediction(y_pred) is converted into a csv file called 'submission.csv'.
